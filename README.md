# With deep curiosity about how technology can break down complex problems, empower people, and create real, lasting impact. I’m on a mission to make robotics and AI education and innovation accessible to everyone, globally.

At the centre of my work is a simple question: how do we make AI and robotics easier to understand, build tools and communities that cause innovation, and help people turn learning into real-world solutions?

This curiosity shapes everything I do as a robotics and AI educator, developer relations professional, technical writer, engineer, builder and creator.

### **🔧 Technologies I Work With**  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++  
- **AI & ML Tools:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
